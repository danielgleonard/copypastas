  <file name=".original.md" type="text/markdown" />         <!-- The original copypasta -->
  <file name="$descriptiveName.md" type="text/markdown" />  <!-- Derivative copypasta - multiple -->
</folder>
```

## Copypastas

### Formatting

* .md files
* Use *italics* for titles of books/movies
* Place an empty line between paragraphs

### Fancy stuff

#### Quotation marks

You must use the fancy curved Unicode versions of American English [quotation marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark).

## Issues

### Issue title

Keep them descriptive, but short. Nobody wants to read a long title and decipher it before finding out it doesn't pertain to them. Put the details in the body.

### Issue body

* Provide links to problematic files
* If there is a conflict with a standard, provide a link to or cite said standard
* Elaborate on the issue
